Once there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hill side.
To entertain himself ,he sang out,"Wolf,Wolf is chasing the sheep."
When the vllagers heard the cry ,they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away.
But, when they arrived they saw no wolf. 
The boy was amused when he saw their angry faces.
