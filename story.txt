Once there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hill side.
To entertain himself ,he sang out,"Wolf,Wolf is chasing the sheep."
When the vllagers heard the cry ,they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away.
But, when they arrived they saw no wolf. 
The boy was amused when he saw their angry faces. 
"Dont Scream Wolf,Boy." warned the Villagers,"When there is no wolf."
They angrily went back down the hill.
Later, Shepherd boy cried out once again,"Wolf,Wolf is chasing the sheep."
To his amusement ,he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.
As they saw there was no wolf,they said strictly,"save your frightened cry for when there is really a wolf,dont cry wolf when ther is no wolf"
They boy grinned at there words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.
later the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock.
Alrmed he jumped on his feat and cried out loud as he coul,"Wolf,Wolf"
But the villagers thought he was fooling them again,so they didnt came up to help.
At sunset,the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn't returned with their sheep.
Went they went up the hill thedy found him weeping.
